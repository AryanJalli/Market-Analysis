🛍️ E-Commerce Customer Segmentation & Market Basket Analysis
This project analyzes real-world online retail data to uncover customer insights and purchasing patterns. Using Recency-Frequency-Monetary (RFM) analysis and KMeans clustering, customers are segmented into actionable groups such as high-value, loyal, and at-risk. Additionally, market basket analysis is performed using the Apriori algorithm to identify frequently purchased item combinations and generate association rules that can inform cross-sell strategies. The project includes data cleaning, feature engineering, clustering, association rule mining, and insightful visualizations — providing a comprehensive end-to-end data science workflow.
